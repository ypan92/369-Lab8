This program expects the traning dataset file to be run as the first commandline argument and the testing dataset file to be run as the second commandline argument.


This is exemplified in the Makefile with:
make job

which translates to 
hadoop jar LargestValue.jar LargestValue /datasets/poker-hand-traning.true.data.txt /datasets/poker-hand-testing.data.txt ./highestValueRaw ./formattedHighestValue

This job requires 4 commandline arguments.  The first 2 are the 2 input data files.

The thrid input is the file name of the raw largest hand information from the first MapReduce Job.

The fourth input is the file name of the formatted output after going through the format MapReduce job.
